# Loops in Java = My Mom Nagging Me to Wake Up (You’ll Feel This)

Before I joined university, I genuinely thought “loop” only meant when Spotify keeps playing the same song on repeat.  
Two months into Java, my whole world changed. Loops are literally the reason your Netflix show auto-plays the next episode, your game character keeps running, and… why my mom can nag me 50 times without typing it 50 times.

### The Pain Before Loops (We’ve All Been Here)
Imagine your lab instructor says:  
“Write a program to print ‘Hello World’ 100 times.”  

Your first instinct (don’t lie):

```java
System.out.println("Hello World");
System.out.println("Hello World");
System.out.println("Hello World");
// ...97 more lines of pure suffering
